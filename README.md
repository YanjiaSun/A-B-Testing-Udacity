# A/B Testing Udacity's Free Trial Screener

## Abstract

## Experiment Overview
>At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the home page: "start free trial", and "access course materials". If the student clicks "start free trial", they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks "access course materials", they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.

>In the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. [This screenshot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByAfiG8HpNUMakVrS0s4cGN2TjQ/view) shows what the experiment looks like.

>The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.

>The unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.

## Experiment Design

### All Metrics

* **Number of cookies**: Number of unique cookies to view course overview page.
* **Number of clicks**: Number of unique cookies to click the "Start Free Trial" button (which happens before the free trial screener is triggered).
* **Number of user-ids**: Number of users who enroll in the free trial.
* **Click-through-probability**: Number of unique cookies to click the "Start Free Trial" button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page.
* **Gross conversion**: Number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in free trial divided by number of unique cookies to click "Start Free Trial" button.
* **Retention**: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make atleast one payment) divided by number of users to enroll in the free trial.
* **Net conversion**: Number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary divided by the number of unique cookies to click the "Start Free Trial" button.

### Metric Choice

#### Invariant metrics:
  1. **Number of cookies**: This is the unit of diversion for the A/B test. Since the visit to the course overview page occurs before the experiment, this metric is independent of the experiment and thus should be evenly distributed between the control and experiment group.

  2. **Number of clicks**: Since the users click before the free trial screener pops up, this metric is also independent of the experiment, and should be evenly distributed between the control and experiment groups.

  3. **Click-through-probability**: This is simply a ratio of the above two metrics, and since they are both independent, this too is independent, and should be evenly distributed between the control and experiment groups.


#### Evaluation metrics:

  1. **Gross conversion**: Ideally, we hypothesize and want the screener to produce a lower conversion rate (because the people who were deterred by the screener are unlikely to make a payment and complete the course, hence freeing up coaching resources), but not at the cost of a lower net conversion rate.

  2. **Net conversion**: While wanting a lower gross conversion rate, we do not want the screener to *significantly reduce* the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course, which means the net conversation should either remain the same (within boundaries). A significantly higher net conversion is also advantageous. While that might be unexpected (and more tests must definitely be done to check), it is quite possible. For instance, students who are willing to put more than 5 hours per week might appreciate the honesty conveyed by the screener, and as a result trust Udacity and give the course a shot - the same students who might have left within the 14 days had the message not been there.


#### Unused metrics:

  1. **Number of user-ids**: This is not a good invariant metric because it is expected to reduce as a result of the experiment. It is not a useful evaluation metric either because a lower number need not necessarily be a good sign unless partnered with other information, in which case the Gross conversion metric already covers this aspect (and more).

  2. **Retention**: This one is more tricky. It's not an invariant metric because it is expected to change, but it's not a good evaluation metric either because the magnitude of change is dependent on the variant number of user-ids (and hence related to Gross conversion). If an experiment has a lower number of user-ids but the same retention rate as the control, that means the *total number* of users passing the free trial is more in the control. Therefore, a higher retention rate could mean that the *a similar number* of users are passing the free trial, and hence is not precise in its meaning. A high retention rate could lead to both a lower, similar, or higher net conversion, depending on the gross conversion. Another way of looking at is that retention is simply net conversion divided by gross conversion, and hence does not provide any meaningful information.

#### What to Look For

In order to launch this experiment, the gross conversion must have a statistically significant and practically significant decrease *and* the net conversion must *not* significantly decrease (statistically). That is, the net conversion can either remain the same as the control (within the margin of error), or increase (significantly or not). If there is a significant increase in net conversion, that's good, but it was not the intended effect and so more tests must be done to deduce what's causing the change.


### Measuring Variability

Now let's calculate the Standard Deviation for both our Evaluation Metrics. Since Gross Conversion and Net Conversion are both probabilities, we can assume a binomial distribution, which will take on a normal distribution for a large enough sample size.

The Udacity baseline values can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MYNUtC47Pg8hdoCjOXaHqF-thheGpUshrFA21BAJnNc/edit#gid=0).

![SE](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1485172999/render.png "Standard Error Formula")

Using the above formula and a sample size of 5000 cookies visiting the course overview page and using the ratio shown in the baseline values, the number of cookies we expect to click on the "Start Free Trial" would be:

```
N = 5000 * 3200/40000
N = 400
```

Then, the Standard Errors for 5000 pageviews will be:

```
Gross Conversion SE...... 0.0202

Net Conversion SE........ 0.0156
```

Since the denominators of both the Evaluation Metrics are the same as the unit of diversion (i.e. cookie), the analytical variability will be similar to the empirical variability, and thus there is no need to calculate that as well.
